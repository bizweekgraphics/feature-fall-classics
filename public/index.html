                <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e live in a world without dress codes. Unless you’re a peer-pressured banker in a navy suit or a germaphobic doctor in scrubs, you can probably wear whatever you like to work. Express yourself, or don’t—in either case, you’ll want things that last. So the following pages don’t offer many crazy new concepts, but some old ones done well. In an era of unlimited freedom, these are pieces that stand out. Wear them this year, at this job—and for many more to come.</p>

                <h2>The Great White Shirt</h2>
                <p>You probably have one. Or 10. That’s why labels are upgrading theirs, creating new basics that play into an easy, minimalist way of getting dressed. For women, silk elevates the style—even better if it ties at the neck. Men: Go for nubby oxford cloth. The cowboy-like details seen here work better in a corporate office than, say, a ranch.</p>

                <p>You probably have one. Or 10. That’s why labels are upgrading theirs, creating new basics that play into an easy, minimalist way of getting dressed.

                <h2>The Novel</h2>
                <p>This women’s sweater, hand-knit in Italy, exemplifies the preppy staple’s new mood: It’s striking, but not so brash it doesn’t go with all your pants. Achieve that balance with an array of dye techniques and cool cuts (at right) or fun embellishments, like the giant links above.</p>

                <h2>The Serious Fall Boots</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_09.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>Last winter’s boots are salt-stained or too L.L. Bean for those days you need to impress the boss. Chelsea boots are stylish, reminiscent of British Mod rockers—and, with their elastic gusset, easy to put on while half-asleep. But any ankle boot will dress you up, so long as you get the leather or suede cleaned regularly (bimonthly, at the very least).</p>

                <h2>The Paddington Bear Coat</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_05.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>The British military called it a duffle, named for the rough Belgian wool it’s made from. Stateside, it’s commonly known as a toggle coat. But even young children will recognize the look: slightly roomy, sloped at the shoulders, often hooded, and fastened in that retro way. For a guy, it’s the ideal dressed-but-not-too-dressed overcoat. Wear it daily; soon, it’ll feel more comfortable than any down-feather cocoon.</p>

                <hr >

                <h2>The Better Gray Pants</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_10.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>When was the last time you put on a pair of dress pants that wasn’t either (a) part of a suit or (b) black? If the answer is more than a week, consider changing your routine. You won’t look like a square—promise—just someone who’s decided to look better. Gray’s the most versatile hue. Add some texture like stripes or checks to banish the Mad Men (R.I.P.) vibe.</p>


                <hr >

                <h2>The Mandatory Plaid</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_11.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>Sure, the motif’s a bit obvious for autumn, but with clothing, “obvious” is just another word for useful. The idea this season is to find a three-tone plaid with several colors forming the grid. Wear a flannel shirt over a T-shirt if your office skews more casual; or opt for a blazer, along with a white dress shirt, if that’s more your daily uniform. The level of brightness is your call, though best to avoid Happy Gilmore pants.</p>

                <h2>The Unboring Black Dress</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_04.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>You know the usual one: It falls from the shoulders, nips at the waist, hits at the knees, and offers little in terms of personality or quality. Time to slip into something more interesting: The Jil Sander below stands out for its architectural seams and sheathed belt. Silky panels are a good add—or start by going for a slightly more daring silhouette.</p>

                <hr >

                <h2>The Earth  Tone Tailored Look</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_03.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>Brown, burgundy, pale green, or even burnt orange: These are the magpie shades designers high (Valentino, Prada) and low (Zara, Suitsupply) are pushing for dressed-up clothes this fall. Find one that flatters your skin tone and wear it often. It’s much more exciting than that navy suit you’re sick of putting on.</p>

                <h2>The Furry Finish</h2>
                <div class="image_full-width"><img class="image" src="img/3615_ETC_A_SHOOT_07.jpg" /></div>
                
                <p>Last fall brought an onslaught of bulky, if not ostentatious, coats with fur, real and faux, allover. That’s given way to a subtler idea: jackets that riff on ones your grandparents might’ve owned, with soft cuffs, collars, or other accents in shearling, authentic animal hides, or a synthetic approximation. Opt for colorful knits or dress shirts beneath for a luxe commuting look (even if you ride the subway). And use the office coat closet—these will look sad hanging on the back of your chair.</p>
